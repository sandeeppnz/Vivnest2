# Architecture Decision Log

Binding rules for the current system. Unlike the roadmap docs, these aren't
meant to change often — treat a violation of one of these as a bug, not a
style preference.

## ADR-001 — Workers never persist directly

Workers (`CameraCaptureWorker`, `AgentHeartbeatWorker`,
`DeviceHeartbeatWorker`) call a dispatcher or handler and stop. They never
call a store/repository themselves.

*Verified:* confirmed in `Vivnest.Agent/Runtime/Workers/*` — every worker's
only persistence-adjacent call is `_dispatcher.PublishAsync(...)` or
`_handler.HandleAsync(...)`.

## ADR-002 — Capability handlers own persistence

`ICapabilityHandler<TEvent>` implementations
(`Vivnest.Agent/Runtime/EventHandlers/*`) are the only place that calls
`IDeviceEventStore`, `IAgentHeartbeatStore`, or `IDeviceHeartbeatStore`.

*Verified:* confirmed — e.g. `CameraCaptureHandler.HandleAsync` is the only
caller of `IDeviceEventStore.SaveAsync` in the capture path.

## ADR-003 — Azure Table Storage is the source of truth

Runtime state is disposable and rebuildable; Table Storage entities
(`DeviceEventEntity`, `AgentHeartbeatEntity`, `DeviceHeartbeatEntity`) are
not. If runtime state and Table Storage ever disagree, Table Storage wins.

## ADR-004 — Queue messages carry only PartitionKey and RowKey

`CameraCapturedQueueMessage`, `CameraCapturedFailedQueueMessage`,
`AgentHeartbeatQueueMessage`, `DeviceHeartbeatQueueMessage` are all
`{PartitionKey, RowKey}` — the consumer re-fetches the full entity from
Table Storage rather than trusting a payload carried on the queue.

*Verified:* confirmed across all four queue message types in
`Vivnest.Core/Queues/Models`. This is also why
[current-architecture.md](current-architecture.md)'s flow always shows
Table Storage before Queue — the queue is a pointer, not a payload.

*Consequence:* this is also exactly why the blob-container validation added
to `CameraCapturedHandler` matters — the entity fetched via that pointer is
trusted more than it should be by default, since nothing upstream
guarantees its contents match what the consumer expects.

## ADR-005 — Cloud determines device health

Health/online/offline status is computed cloud-side, from heartbeat
timestamps, not reported by the agent.

*Implication for the codebase:* `DeviceHeartbeatWorker` currently has a
commented-out `DetermineStatus` method, meaning `DeviceHeartbeat.Status` is
never set agent-side. Earlier in this project's history that looked like
unfinished dead code to fix. Under this ADR, it's arguably dead code that
**should stay dead** — agent-side status computation isn't just incomplete,
it's the wrong layer for it to live in. The correct place for this logic is
the Cloud-side `HealthMonitorTimerFunction` /
`OfflineDetectionRule` / `RecoveryDetectionRule` described in
[../roadmap/roadmap.md](../roadmap/roadmap.md) (Phase 3, Sprint 1), reading
`LastHeartbeatUtc` centrally. When that lands, consider removing the unused
`Status` field/plumbing from the agent side entirely rather than filling it in.

## ADR-006 — Runtime state is transient and separated from persistence

See [current-architecture.md](current-architecture.md)'s "Runtime State"
section — `DeviceRuntimeState` holds only in-memory, rebuildable fields
(`LastCaptureUtc`, `LastFailureUtc`, `LastActivityUtc`, `LastHeartbeatUtc`,
`LastBlobName`, `LastError`). Nothing durable or business-relevant is
allowed to live only in runtime state.

## ADR-007 — Camera is the first device capability, not the only one

Vivnest's target market spans multiple device types (cameras, water meters,
heat pumps, soil sensors, etc.) and verticals (home, commercial CCTV,
agriculture, industrial IoT) — see
[vivnest-runtime-overview.md](vivnest-runtime-overview.md). `DeviceType`
already reflects this (`Camera`, `HumiditySensor`, `SmokeAlarm`,
`WaterLeak`, `HeatPump`, `MotionSensor`, `DoorSensor`), but `ICamera` /
`CameraCaptureService` are the only implemented capture path, and they're
shaped entirely around "capture an image."

*Decision:* don't generalize the capture abstraction speculatively — that
would be guessing at a shape with only one real example to work from.
Generalize it **when the second device type is actually built**, using
both concrete cases (image capture vs. a scalar/periodic sensor reading) to
find the real shared interface. Treat "what does device type #2 look like"
as a deliberate design question at that point, not something to discover
halfway through an unrelated feature.

*Consequence:* code that's obviously camera-specific by name
(`CameraCaptureWorker`, `ICameraFactory`, etc.) is expected to stay
camera-specific for now — that's not a defect to fix today, it's waiting on
its second data point.

## ADR-008 — Multi-tenancy is a day-one constraint, not a later migration

`TenantId` / `SiteId` / `AgentId` are already on every domain event and
heartbeat (`DeviceEvent`, `AgentHeartbeat`, `DeviceHeartbeat`), because the
commercial target (managing many customers' independent sites, not just one
household) was anticipated from the start.

*Decision:* the REST API and dashboard (roadmap.md Phase 3, Sprints 4-5),
when built, must be tenant-scoped from their first version — every query
filtered by tenant, no endpoint that can return data across tenants without
explicit intent. Retrofitting tenant isolation into an API that was built
single-tenant is a much bigger job than building it in from the start,
and there's no forcing function to catch the mistake later (nothing in the
current architecture rejects a cross-tenant query — it has to be enforced
at the API layer deliberately).
